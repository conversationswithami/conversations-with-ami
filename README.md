# Conversations with Ami — website

## What is this?
This folder is your actual website — every file needed to make it work.
You upload it to Cloudflare (free hosting), then point your domain at it.
No coding required for any of this.

## Step-by-step: deploying to Cloudflare Pages

**1. Log into Cloudflare**
Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com and sign in (or sign up, free).

**2. Find Workers & Pages**
In the left sidebar, click **Workers & Pages**.

**3. Start a new project**
Click **Create application** (top right).

**4. Choose Pages, not Workers**
You'll likely land on a Workers-focused screen first. Look for a link near
the top or bottom of that screen that says something like
**"Looking to deploy Pages? Get started"** and click it.
(If you instead see two clear tabs labeled **Workers** and **Pages**, just
click the **Pages** tab.)

This step matters — Workers does *not* support the `functions/api` folder
this site needs for the podcast episode list and newsletter archive to
update automatically. Pages does.

**5. Upload the site**
Choose **Upload assets** (as opposed to connecting a GitHub repo).
Drag in the zip file (`conversations-with-ami-site.zip`) — Cloudflare will
unzip it automatically. If you unzip it yourself first, drag in the
folder's *contents* (index.html, css, js, functions, assets all visible at
the top level) rather than a folder-within-a-folder.

**6. Name it and deploy**
Give the project a name (e.g. `conversations-with-ami`), leave build
settings blank/default, click **Deploy**.

**7. Confirm it works**
Cloudflare gives you a link like `your-project-name.pages.dev`. Open it.
Click through to the Podcast page too — episodes may take a few seconds
to load the first time.

## Connect your Squarespace domain

1. In the same Cloudflare Pages project: **Custom domains** tab →
   **Set up a custom domain** → type your domain (e.g. `conversationswithami.com`).
2. Cloudflare will show a DNS record to add (usually a CNAME pointing at
   your `.pages.dev` address) — or, since your domain's DNS is already on
   Cloudflare, it may offer to add this automatically. Let it, if so.
3. If it instead gives you a record to add manually: go to
   **Squarespace → Domains → your domain → DNS Settings**, and add exactly
   what Cloudflare showed you.
4. Give it anywhere from a few minutes up to a day to take effect.

Squarespace keeps owning the domain registration — it just stops hosting,
and hands visitors to Cloudflare instead. The `.pages.dev` link works fine
for testing in the meantime, before the domain is connected.

## Two things that make content update automatically

### Podcast episodes — already working, no setup needed
The RSS feed URL (`https://api.riverside.com/hosting/qfuudTdb.rss`) is
already built into the code. As soon as the site is deployed on Pages
(not Workers), the episode list will populate itself and stay current.

### Newsletter archive — one setup step (Kit API key)
This one needs a piece of account access from Kit, so it has to be a
secret rather than something baked into these files (a secret in the code
would be visible to anyone who ever saw the site's files). Here's the setup:

1. In Kit: **Settings → Developer** → **Add a new key** → name it anything
   (e.g. "Website") → copy the key immediately (Kit only shows it once).
2. In your Cloudflare Pages project: **Settings → Environment variables**
   → **Add variable**.
3. Name: `KIT_API_KEY` (exactly that). Value: the key you copied.
   Add it for both **Production** and **Preview**.
4. Save, and redeploy if it doesn't redeploy automatically.
5. Going forward, whenever you send a broadcast in Kit, toggle it as
   **Public** while sending — that's what generates the shareable link.
   Only broadcasts marked Public appear in the archive; anything else
   stays private, same as it already is.

Once set, new issues show up on the Newsletter Archive page within about
15 minutes of sending — nothing to upload by hand.

## The newsletter sign-up form
Already wired in and working — no action needed. It appears on all three
pages via the embed you sent earlier.

## The About page
Already has the real bio/copy in place — no action needed.

## What's still needed from you
- [ ] The Kit API key (5-minute setup above) — this is the only remaining piece
- [ ] Sending your first Public-marked newsletter issue, whenever ready
